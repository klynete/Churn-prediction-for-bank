Churn is a big problem for most companies. Losing customers requires investment in new customer acquisition to replace them. This could be several times more expensive than retaining existing customers, depending on the domain. Research on churn in the banking system can help banks identify the factors that contribute to customer churn, as well as develop strategies to reduce it. This can include identifying at-risk customers, understanding their reasons for leaving, and implementing targeted retention programs.
